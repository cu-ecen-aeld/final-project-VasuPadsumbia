# Smart Weather Station – Final Project

This repository contains the individual submission for the Embedded Linux final project. The goal of this project is to build a low‑power smart weather station using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, custom software, and a tailored Buildroot Linux system.

## Project Overview

Our station reads data from a BME280 sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure) and publishes the measurements to a cloud dashboard over Wi‑Fi. The device uses a Buildroot‑based Linux image customized for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and includes Python scripts for sensor interfacing, an MQTT client for data transmission, and optional local web configuration through a Flask API.

The detailed project plan — including goals, system architecture, hardware specifications, open‑source components, sprint schedule, and team roles — is documented in our shared Project Overview wiki page: [👉 Project Overview]([https://github.com/VasuPadsumbia/Smart-Weather-Station/wiki])

Please refer to the wiki for design diagrams and the full schedule.

## Repository Structure

- `/buildroot/` — Buildroot configuration and board files (in group repository).
- `/app/` — User‑space application code (Python) for sensor reading, MQTT publishing, and web API.
- `/docs/` — Additional documentation or diagrams if needed.

(Individual repositories may contain a subset of the above, depending on personal contributions.)

## Getting Started

To build and run the project:

1. Clone the group repository and follow the Buildroot README to build the SD‑card image.
2. Connect the BME280 sensor to the Pi Zero 2 W’s I²C pins (3.3 V, GND, SDA, SCL).
3. Flash the generated image onto a microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power up.
4. The Python application should start automatically and begin publishing data to the configured MQTT broker.
